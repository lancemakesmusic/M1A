# EAS Submission Wait Time - What to Expect

## ⏱️ Normal Wait Times

### "Waiting for an available submitter"
This message means:
- ✅ Your submission is **queued** and waiting
- ⏳ EAS is processing other submissions ahead of you
- 📊 This is **normal** and can take time

### Typical Wait Times:
- **Short queue**: 2-5 minutes
- **Normal queue**: 5-15 minutes
- **Busy queue**: 15-30 minutes
- **Very busy**: 30-60 minutes (rare)

---

## 🔍 Why It Takes Time

1. **EAS Queue System**:
   - Multiple developers submitting builds
   - EAS processes them one at a time
   - Your submission is in line

2. **Apple Processing**:
   - After EAS submits, Apple processes
   - Apple validation takes 5-10 minutes
   - Total time: Queue + Apple processing

3. **Peak Times**:
   - Mornings (US time) = Busier
   - Weekdays = More submissions
   - Evenings = Usually faster
