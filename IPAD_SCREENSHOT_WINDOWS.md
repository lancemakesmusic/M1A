## ✅ Solution 3: Use Physical iPad (If Available)

If you have access to an iPad:

1. **Install TestFlight app** on iPad
2. **Install your app** from TestFlight
3. **Take screenshot:**
   - Press **Power + Volume Up** buttons simultaneously
   - Screenshot saved to Photos
4. **Transfer to computer:**
   - Email it to yourself
   - Or use iCloud Photos
   - Or connect iPad via USB
5. **Verify size:**
   - iPad Pro 12.9-inch screenshots should already be correct size
   - If not, resize using Solution 1
6. **Upload to App Store Connect**

## ✅ Solution 4: Use Mac in Cloud Service (If Needed)

If you need a real iOS Simulator:

1. **MacStadium** or **MacinCloud** (paid services)
2. **GitHub Actions** (free, but more complex)
3. **Borrow a Mac** from friend/colleague

**Note:** This is usually overkill for just getting a screenshot.
